# Algorithms and Data Structures
Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and exercises from my Algorithms and Data Structures course. I am a recent high school graduate and currently a student at Southwest Technical College, where I am currently enrolled in their software development program. This repository reflects my journey as I work through various programming challenges and develop my skills

Feel free to browse through my projects, which include both completed assignments and personal initiatives inspired by the concepts I’ve learned. I hope this collection of work showcases my growth and learning in the field. My passion for programming started as a hobby, and I’m excited to transform it into a professional career. I hope to share my progress.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
